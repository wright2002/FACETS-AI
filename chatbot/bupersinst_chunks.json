The eNAVFIT interface and NAVFIT98A application use \nNAVPERS 1610/2 Fitness Report and Counseling Record (W2-O6) and NAVPERS 1610/5 Fitness \nReport and Counseling Record (O7-O8) for fitness evaluations (FITREP) for officers, NAVPERS \n1616/27 Evaluation and Counseling Record (E7-E9) for chief evaluations (CHIEFEVAL), and \nNAVPERS 1616/26 Evaluation Report and Counseling Record (E1-E6) for all other enlisted \npersonnel evaluations (EVAL).  Performance traits are graded on a 5-point scale, from 1.0 (lowest) \nto 5.0 (highest), using performance standards printed on the forms.  The performance trait grade of \n3.0 represents performance to full Navy standards.  Higher grades are reserved for performance that \nsignificantly exceeds standards.  All forms provide a five-step promotion recommendation scale:  \n\"Significant Problems,\" \"Progressing,\" \"Promotable,\" \"Must Promote,\" and \"Early Promote.\"  \n\"Early Promote\" recommendation is based solely on performance and does not require eligibility for \nearly promotion.  There are, however, mandatory limits on the number of \"Early Promote\" \nrecommendations.  For paygrades O-1 and O-2, with the exception of limited duty officers (LDO), \nno promotion recommendation higher than “Promotable” is allowed.  For the more senior officer \nand enlisted paygrades, there are also limits on \"Must Promote\" recommendations.  These limits \nensure a sufficient range of recommendations that make the reports useful to the promotion system.  \nFor enlisted personnel, the promotion recommendation is also the performance mark average for the \nreport period.  Refer to chapter 16, section 16-3 for guidance."

The term \n\"commanding officer\" (CO) is inclusive of all DoD Services and their civilian equivalents within \nthe United States (U.S.) Federal Government.  OICs are reporting seniors if they are in charge of \ncommissioned or established activities listed in the OPNAVINST 5400.45A.

    "text": "BUPERSINST 1610.1 0G CH-1 \n5 May 2025 \n5. How Do We Perform the Counseling? COs and OICs dictate the counseling methods they will\nuse. Performance counseling will be performed at the mid-point of the periodic report cycle and at\nthe signing of the report. The mid-term performance-counseling schedule is listed in chapter 18 of\nenclosure (2) in this instruction. The supervisor as coach, henceforward referred to as \"supervisor,\"\nwill be a supervisor who participates in the Service member's EV AL, CHIEFEVAL, or FITREP\npreparation. COs will oversee the counseling program and monitor the supervisor's performance\nand results. The objectives are to provide feedback to the Sailor as performer, henceforward called\n''member'' and motivate and assist improvement. Performance cow1seling starts with a fair\nassessment of the Service member's performance and capabilities, in which the member\ncontributes. It identifies the member's strengths and opportunities for improvement. It should\nconcentrate on performance and preparing to give, receive, and ask for feedback. NA VPERS\n1616/26 (EVAL form), NAVPERS 1616/27 (CHIEFEVAL), NAVPERS 1610/2 and 1610/5\n(FITREP) forms, and NAVPERS 1610/19 Military Individual Development Plan (IDP) are used as\ncounseling worksheets and must be signed by the supervisor and member. Supervisors may use the\ntick marks next to each performance standard and assign tentative trait ratings and may write\ncomments. Under no circumstances should a future promotion recommendation be promised during\nperformance counseling. Guidance regarding the delivery of counseling and feedback is available\non the MyNavyHR Web site: https://www.myna, yhr.nav .mil/Career-Management/Performance­\nEvaluation/MidTerm Counseling/ and also paragraph 9 of this enclosure (1) and chapters 13 and\n18 of the EV ALMAN ( enclosure (2)). For guidance on GRGB behaviors and characteristics to\nfacilitate counseling, expectation setting, and performance assessments see the GRGB Web site:\nhttps:// grgb.navy.mil.\n6. How Do We Administer the Svstem? The Navy Performance Evaluation Program is the\nresponsibility of the Chief of Naval Personnel. As such, only that office may modify personnel\nevaluation policies and procedures. COs and OICs are encouraged to establish local procedures for\nsuch matters as Service member input forms, delegation plan, guidance for delegated reporting\nseniors and raters, maintaining uniform grading and promotion recommendation standards, and\nreview of adverse or other delegated reports that require command review.\n7. Set Performance Expectations. Reporting seniors of officers, warrant officers, and CPOs must\nconduct a performance expectation setting meeting with subordinates within 30 days of a member's\ncheck-in with the command or the previous FITREP or CHIEFEV AL date. Raters, senior raters, or\nreporting seniors must conduct an expectation setting meeting with E-6 and below within 30 days of\na member's check-in with the command or the previous EVAL report date. These expectations\nshould be recorded and revisited during the member's Mid-term counseling.\n8. Navy Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Narrative. Adherence to the\nrequirements of the SAPR Program, along with handling of sexual harassment and sexual assault\ncases, may be considered and assessed utilizing Block 34 (CHIEFEV AL and FITREP) for all CPOs,\nwarrant officers, and officers or Block 35 (EVAL) for all third-class petty officers and above.\nSAPR statements are not mandatory for Service members but may be included as part of a\nprimary/collateral duty or when collaborative documentation is warranted.\n4 \nEnclosure (1) \ny"

GRGB is a call to action for every Navy leader to apply a set of\nNavy-proven leadership and problem-solving best practices that empower our people to achieve\nexceptional performance.  All reporting seniors must comment in narrative block 41 about specific\nbehaviors that support GRGB for all commander and captain FITREPs.  Reporting seniors should\nalso comment regarding specific GRGB behaviors in other FITREPs and EVALs when warranted\nby performance.  GRGB concepts should be front of mind for all personnel and adhering to these\nstandards should be part of goal setting, midterm counseling, and performance evaluation.  General\nguidance for GRGB is provided below (find more resources at https://grgb.navy.mil).\na.\nGet Real.  Get Real is about having the courage to self-assess, to build teams that embrace\nhonest, hard, transparent looks at our performance to understand our actual strengths and \nshortcomings.  We must be our own toughest critics. \nb. Get Better.  Get Better is about a commitment to improve, to be self-correcting.  It involves\ntaking pride in high standards and fixing problems together when they are small, before they grow \nlarge and complex.  Get Better also involves applying proven methods to address top priorities in a \nfocused and disciplined way, and not by just adding activity. \nc.\nGRGB Comment Implementation.  Reporting seniors must avoid making vague/generalized\ncomments.  Comments must be specific and substantiated with data or metrics in the write-up that \ntie leadership behaviors or performance to measurable outcomes and process improvement.  \nExamples below demonstrate statements that should or should not be used in write-ups when \nreferring to GRGB: \n(1) Should not be used:\n(a) “Captain Smith exhibits GRGB behaviors daily.”\n(b) “Commander Smith embraces the red.”\n(2) Should be used:\n(a) “By embracing the red, Captain Smith identified process challenges in her\nengineering department and streamlined them 30% through root cause analysis – directly enabling a \nsuccessful INSURV.” \n(b) “Commander Smith identified two crew qualifications that were no longer required\nand raised the barrier to her ISIC – the quals were removed across the wing returning 200 flying \nhours to each squadron.”"

This includes aligning on standards and goals and finding and embracing “the red.” \n(a) Aligning on Standards and Goals.  Sailors must act with a clear sense of mission,\nunderstanding the standards and goals that they or their teams are working towards.  This includes \nthe pursuit of data to create or clarify measures and metrics.  Sailors must act transparently.  They \nshould seek clarity and direction, instead of making assumptions, and they should find stakeholders \nwho can assist.  Leaders must, for every task, ensure their people understand “the why” and the \ntask’s standards or goals.  FITREP comments that reflect aligning on standards and goals should \ninclude implementing and documenting process improvement that use Navy best practices.  \nEffective use of daily management and daily visual management techniques are also attributes of \naligning on standards and goals. \n(b) Finding and Embracing the Red.  “The red” refers to those areas where Navy teams\nor Sailors are not meeting standards or goals or progressing toward desired outcomes.  Sailors must \nbe curious and exercise extreme ownership in identifying those “red” areas for improvement.  \nTransparency matters, Sailors must have the courage to shine a light on areas where they or their \nteams fall short, embracing both the obligation to speak up and the opportunity to get better.  All \nSailors are expected to foster an environment that inspires others to act transparently through hard, \nopen and honest conversations that encourage everyone to get better.  FITREP comments that \nreflect finding and embracing the red should include how Sailors act transparently both about \nthemselves and their organization, how they display exceptional ownership of an issue or foster an \nenvironment that encourages open and honest communication. \n(2) Getting Better.  Sailors must act on what matters most, self-correcting effectively.  This\nincludes using proven problem-solving methods and fixing or elevating barriers. \n(a) Using Proven Problem-Solving Methods.  Sailors must take time to understand what\nproblem they are trying to solve and apply Navy performance improvement tools to those problems.  \nSailors must move beyond symptoms of problems to help identify root causes.  This often involves \nvisiting the location of the problem and collaborating with other stakeholders.  Sailors are expected \nto use critical thinking to determine and act on what matters most in fixing problems facing their \nteams.  Sailors should put solutions in place that will last beyond their tenure.  FITREP comments \nthat reflect using proven problem-solving methods should demonstrate the effective use of root \ncause analysis, problem solving canvases, or other techniques to gain deeper understanding of \nchallenges."

Sailors must identify and act on what matters most,\naddressing and communicating specific barriers that limit performance or mission accomplishment.  \nThey must work to fix barriers internally or with peer help.  Sailors should focus on those barriers to \nperformance that matter most and elevate those barriers that require external assistance by candidly \nreporting them as needed.  FITREP comments that reflect fixing or elevating barriers should \ndocument how a Sailor effectively identifies, fixes, or elevates specific barriers.  Comments on how \neffective they are in receiving barriers from their subordinates are appropriate as well. \n(3) Building Learning Teams.  Underlying the behaviors of GRGB are the behaviors of\nbuilding high-performance learning teams.  Two specific areas of behavior that support building \nlearning teams are encouraging learning through trust and respect and specifying ownership. \n(a) Encouraging Learning through Trust and Respect.  Sailors must model humility, be\nauthentic, show empathy, and nurture trust and respect for each person.  They should reject the idea \nof being a “know-it-all” in favor of being a “learn-it-all.”  This involves seeking and considering all \nviews and previous lessons learned.  Sailors must also encourage others to speak up and share their \nideas.  Leaders must ensure that the climate of their teams reflect these values.  FITREP comments \nthat reflect encouraging learning through trust and respect should include statements on how a \nSailor encourages psychological safety, inspires and develops subordinates both professionally and \npersonally, as well as how they specifically create and develop effective teams.  \n(b) Specifying Ownership.  Sailors are expected to seize ownership of their assigned\nmissions and provide full support to those who own standards, goals, barriers, or problems.  \nFITREP comments that specify ownership should demonstrate how a Sailor links tasks to outcomes; \nties accomplishments to purpose; or when acting between organizations, effectively employs a \nsupported/supporting commander construct. \n10. Report Types.  There are three types of reports:\na.\nRegular.  Regular reports are the foundation of the performance record and must be\nsubmitted periodically per Table 1 schedule and on other occasions specified in the Navy \nPerformance Evaluation System Manual (EVALMAN).  They must cover, day-for-day, all naval \nservice on active duty (ACDU) or inactive duty (INACT) drilling Reserve duty, except for enlisted \ninitial entry training and other limited circumstances. \nb. Concurrent Reports.  Concurrent reports provide a record of significant performance for\nmembers fulfilling additional duty (ADDU) or temporary additional duty (TEMADD).  They are \noptional, unless directed by higher authority and may not be submitted by anyone in the regular \nreporting senior's direct chain of command.  A Concurrent report must be countersigned by the \nregular reporting senior, who may also make it the Regular report for the period concerned if \ncontinuity is maintained with the previous Regular or Regular/Concurrent report.  Refer to \nEVALMAN, chapter 4 for detailed requirements."

    "page": 13,
    "text": "BUPERSINST 1610.10G \n28 Jan 2025 \n8\nEnclosure (1) \nc.\nOperational Commander Reports.  Operational Commander reports are optional and may\nonly be submitted on COs or OICs, as observed by their operational commanders who are not also \ntheir regular reporting seniors.  Refer to EVALMAN, chapter 5 for detailed requirements. \n11. What are the Administrative Blocks?  The administrative blocks (i.e., blocks 1, 3-19, blocks\n22-26, block 44 (FITREP and CHIEFEVAL) or 48 (EVAL)) identify the report, define the context\nin which it was received, and makes it more informative to detailers and selection boards.  They\nalso permit computerized compliance audits by NAVPERSCOM to assure fairness to all Service\nmembers and reporting seniors.  Each command should have a quality review procedure for\nFITREPs, CHIEFEVALs, and EVALs paying very close attention to ensure the correct member and\nreporting senior’s Social Security numbers (SSN) are accurate to avoid report rejections by\nNAVPERSCOM’s automated data file systems.  After acceptance to the official military personnel\nfile (OMPF), the correction of an incorrect reporting senior’s SSN requires submission of\nsupplemental material to correct the discrepancy.  For specific directions concerning supplementary\nmaterial, refer to chapter 15.\n12. Guidance on Trait Grades.  The meanings of the trait grades are printed on the form, along with\nrepresentative performance standards.  The 5.0 trait grade is reserved for performance that is far\nabove standards.  The 1.0 trait grade means poor performance that is not improving or\nunsatisfactory performance with respect to a single standard.  For the majority of Service members,\nmost trait grades should be in the 3.0 to 4.0 range.  Definitions are stated relative to both\nperformance in that trait and promotability with respect to that trait.\na.\nSuperstar Performance - 5.0:  Could be promoted two paygrades and still be a standout in\nthis trait. \nb. Advanced Performance - 4.0:  Far more than promotion-ready in this trait right now.\nc.\nDependable, \"Fully Qualified,\" Journeyman Performance - 3.0:  Can handle this aspect of\nthe next higher paygrade. \nd. Useful, Promising Performance - 2.0:  Needs development in this trait, but member is\npromotable if overall performance warrants it.  Exception - 2.0 trait grade cannot be assigned in \ncommand or organizational climate/equal opportunity on reports in paygrades E-1 through E-6 and \nW-1 through O-6 and maintain a promotion recommendation of “Promotable” or higher.  For\npaygrades E-7 through E-9, a 2.0 trait grade cannot be assigned in character and maintain a\npromotion recommendation of “Promotable” or higher.\ne.\nDisappointing Performance - 1.0:  Until deficiencies are remedied in this trait, should not be\npromoted, regardless of performance in other traits."

The software provides help-screens, spell-check, calculates individual trait averages, and \nhas validation features that will prevent many common errors.  The interface may be accessed at:  \nhttp://www.bol.navy.mil/BAM/ menu.aspx.  Select “eNAVFIT Program”.  The eNAVFIT User \nGuide may be reviewed and downloaded at:  https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-\nManagement/Performance-Evaluation/eNAVFIT/.  The interface also contains a blank \ninteractive Adobe form for all paygrades that is authorized for use as an offline extension of the \neNAVFIT interface titled “NAVPERS 16XX.”  This interactive Adobe form contains validation \nchecks similar to the online version, permits electronic routing, printing, and digital signature on \ncompleted reports.

For purposes of \nthis manual, a CO is any person (military or civilian) who exercises command or direction of a \ncommissioned or established Navy or Marine Corps unit or activity or an administrative or task \norganization of such units or activities (which has been established by competent authority); or an \nequivalent unit, activity, or organization in another department or agency of the U.S. Federal \nGovernment.  Normally, a Navy or Marine Corps unit or activity has been commissioned if it is \nlisted in the OPNAVINST 5400.45A (Standard Navy Distribution List (SNDL)).

Request for !SIC Review. A Service member may request an informal review by the\nreporting senior's ISIC for reports believed to be unjust. If authority to sign as reporting senior has \nbeen delegated (see chapter 2), then the ISIC of the delegating authority must conduct the review. \nA member who desires an ISIC review must make a written request within IO days of seeing the \nreport. An ISIC may still conduct an informal review if the request is delayed beyond a 10-day \nperiod for good cause. Scope of the review is at the discretion of the ISIC but should assess \nwhether the evaluation was an unbiased, fair, accurate, and realistic assessment of the member's \nperformance. The ISIC must complete the informal review of the report within 20 days of receiving \nthe request notification and provide feedback via the reporting senior or delegating authority.

Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence by the member concerned, the BCNR may \nrecommend to the Secretary of the Navy that the record be changed. If the petition is to be \nconsidered and resolved prior to the convening of a selection board, the petition should be received \nby the BCNR at least 4 months before the board convenes. The BCNR normally will not act on a \npetition if any other type of appeal is pending or in progress. \nc.

This should be an open \ndiscussion of individual performance, with reference to the performance traits on the EVAL or \nFITREP form.  Within this chapter are schedules, requirements, record keeping, and methods for \nconducting the PC&C sessions."
